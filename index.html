        <h2>Some things about me:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Grew up in CA - loved it, and then I discovered one can live without a car</li>
            <li>Studied computer things at MIT, grateful to have made incredible friends who I love and inspire me</li>
            <li>I do software and AI things in SF</li>
            <li>One day I will live out forever in NYC</li>
            <li>Currently learning from the amazing people at SPC</li>
            <li>Started a <a href="https://feanixbio.com" target="_blank">company</a> </li>
            <li>I spent some time conducting organic inspections for the USDA</li>
            <li>I have spent a bunch of time thinking about agriculture, food systems, genomics, artificial wombs, eating disorder recovery, AI therapy, recruiting</li>
            <li>not to be confused with gen Z <a href="https://jenaalsup.com" target="_blank" >Alsup</a>, the smarter and funnier one</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Some things I am thinking about. If you have any insights I would love if you sent me an email with your thoughts, or to grab coffee!: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Do all parents want their kids to have a better life than they did? What if their life is already great? In an abundant world and society, what do you teach your kids to strive for?</li>
            <li>What needs to happen to implement the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/the-rail-plus-property-model" target="_blank"> rail + propery model</a> in the US?</li>
            <li>Who is working on artificial wombs? Can I help? When will it be ready?</li>
            <li>I don't care about luxury goods. I just want to live a car-less life with community and loved ones around me. For some reason, in the US this is priced as a luxury good. Therefore to my great disdain there is in fact a luxury good I want. How do we make cities the affordable default and do away with the soulless parking lot nature of suburbia?</li>
            <li>At what age gap between two kids are they effectively just only children?</li>
        </ul>
